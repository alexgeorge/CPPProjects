/**
 * @brief Recursive function to find the fibonocci
 * However this function is having a time complexity 
 * of O(2^n) (recursive method) and space complexity of O(n). 
 * Time complexity indicate the  number of times
 * a compute operation is called and space complexity indicate the level of stack 
 * build up while running the algorithm. This can be explained representing this 
 * problem as a binary tree. More details - 
 * Optimizing using map which holds the key and value for memoization
 * Dynamic programming (DP) means solving problems recursively by combining 
 * the solutions to similar smaller overlapping subproblems.
 * memoization technique is a routine trick applied in dynamic programming (DP)
 * this eliminate repetation of same computation by storing the result for 
 * easy reference
 * 2^n time complexity for the binary tree parse
 * 
 * Theme:- Compare recursive and iterative methods:-
 * Time Complexity
 * There are O(N) recursive calls in our recursive approach, 
 * and each call uses O(1) operations. Thus, the time complexity 
 * of factorial using recursion is O(N)
 * There are O(N) iterations of the loop in our iterative approach, 
 * so its time complexity is also O(N).
 * Though both the programsâ€™ theoretical time complexity is the same, 
 * a recursive program will take more time to execute due to the overhead of function calls, 
 * which is much higher than that of iteration.
 * 
 * Space Complexity:-
 * In the recursive program, due to each recursive call, some memory gets allocated in the stack 
 * to store parameters and local variables. As there are O(N) recursive calls, 
 * the space complexity using recursion is O(N).
 * No extra memory gets allocated in the iterative program, 
 * so its space complexity is O(1).
 *
